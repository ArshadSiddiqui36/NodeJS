Events Module

Node.js has a built-in module, called "Events",
Where we can create-, fire-, and listen for- our own events.

Example 1 - Registering for the events to be fired only one time events.

Example 2 - Create an events emitter instance and register a couple of callbacks.

Example 3 - Registering for the events with callback parameters.
